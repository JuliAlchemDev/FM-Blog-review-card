## My process

After receiving feedback suggesting I customize the project more by editing styles with my own classes,  
I decided to apply the **BEM naming convention**. It really helped me organize the structure and optimize my workflow.

### What I learned

- Using a **design system** to define custom properties (CSS variables) makes your work more flexible.
- Practicing a **mobile-first workflow**.  
  I discovered that measurements in design files are usually for desktop versions,  
  so adjusting font sizes with `rem` units for mobile is essential.
- Learned to implement custom fonts with **`@font-face`** for the first time.
- Practiced **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** layouts.  
  It can be tricky at first, but once you get it, itâ€™s incredibly helpful.
- While exploring the **Figma file**, I finally understood the difference between  
  **Auto layout** and **Layout**, as well as the resizing options (*hug, fixed*, etc.).


### Built with
